SOON:

 * finish libffi implementation for emscripten
 * get all the testcases passing again

improve the jitted code:
 * compile everything into a single module to avoid func call overhead
 * generate switch or if or something else depending on the conditions
   that we're actually processing, rather than always doing a switch.
 * avoid lots of pointless swapping of variables
 * suspended exprs to reduce variable pressure
 * tighten up code around func calls
    * don't use the frame for gcroot, to reduce need for write barrier?
    * don't spill thing to frame if they're already there
 * shared helper code for failing guards?
 * remove unneeded conversions to unsigned e.g. in write barrier?
 * reduce number of comparisons in write barrier
 * somehow reduce overhead of dynCall_XXX()?
   * maybe send relevant funcs into the jitted code via plt?


EVENTUALLY:

* pypy thinks we have st_atim, when we don't

* sizeof off_t is not longlong

* CallDescr and function pointers in the JIT; we need to re-work this
  to make sure that calls are being done, and to work around the
  pointer-aliasing issues that are unique to emscripten.
   * for now, we're using ALISING_FUNCTION_POINTERS=0 in emscripten settings,
     but this generates a significant increase in code size.
   * things to do to fix
     * fix indexing of bytcode_for_address to take into account the calldescr
       as well as the function pointer address

* use emscripten_get_now() for performance timing?

* have to figure out the "stack check" thing and what I need to do to
  make it work in the jit, and in js in general (this is the thing that
  raises a nice python-level error when you recurse too much)

* things to try:
  * experiment with --gcremovetypeptr, see what difference it makes
    to memory usage, and make sure the jit still works
  * --clever-malloc-removal

* llvm `mergefunc` to merge a bunch of trivial, identical helper functions
  * this may not work, we should consider a similar pass for emscripten

* --llvm-lto=3

* using closure on the compiled shell
